							<div class="subheading">2013-08-26 23:15 GMT-0600 - Nick Williams</div>
							A lot has happened in the last month! Our TeamCity and YouTrack licenses expired, but we have been delayed renewing them due to the need to replace a server and deal with a lightning strike.<br />

							<div class="subheading">2012-08-31 21:41 GMT-0600 - Nick Williams</div>
							A new issue tracking system has been deployed and is available now for bug and feature reporting and tracking. Our issue tracking system was previously The Bug Genie. We have migrated to JetBrains's YouTrack system because of improved usability and enhanced features.<br />

							<div class="subheading">2012-08-23 07:12 GMT-0600 - Nick Williams</div>
							A new integrated build environment has been deployed and can be used and referenced by all. Our previous environment was TeamCity 6.0 with a Professional (free) license, limiting us to 20 build configurations and 3 build agents. Our new environment is TeamCity 7.1 with a OpenSource Enterprise license.<br />

							<div class="subheading">2012-05-23 06:30 GMT-0600 - Nick Williams</div>
							A release candidate is available for the first version of our License Manager project. The License Manager is a Java-based license management library for use by any Java project to maintain intellectual property security. You can use License Manager to help you create, issue and manage licenses for your commercial product. The first version has full capabilities and comes with a text-based user interface for generating public/private keys and licenses.<br />

							<div class="subheading">2012-05-23 06:28 GMT-0600 - Nick Williams</div>
							We have lots of ideas for upcoming projects. The Raw Sockets project gets our full attention starting next week, now that License Manager has a release candidate. Additionally, we are currently brainstorming several other network-protocol-related projects and a multi-face PowerDNS management GUI.<br />
