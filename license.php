							<h2>Why Open Source?</h2>
							We believe that all developers can benefit from the tools contained within NWTS Java Code, and we want to share our work with the software developer community. There are also broader, more concrete reasons to support Open Source projects, and we present a few quotes below in support:<br />
<br />
<div class="bubble">"Open source is a development method for software that harnesses the power of distributed peer review and transparency of process. The promise of open source is better quality, higher reliability, more flexibility, lower cost, and an end to predatory vendor lock-in."</div><span><a href="http://www.opensource.org/node/552" target="_blank">The Open Source Initiative</a></span><br />
<br />
<div class="bubble">Open source software "returns control to the customer. You can see the code, change it, learn from it. Bugs are found and fixed quickly. And when customers are unhappy with one vendor, they can choose another without overhauling their entire infrastructure. No more technology lock-in. No more monopolies."</div><span><a href="http://www.redhat.com/about/whyopensource/" target="_blank">redhat</a></span><br />
